I am currently undertaking my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Edinburgh, with my main focus in the field of Natural Language Processing. I am currently supervised internally by Adam Lopez, and externally by Alan Nichol, from Rasa. My dissertation focuses on modeling dialogue with a conversational agent, with the aim of detecting (and avoiding) dialogue breakdown.

I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, where my undergraduate thesis was supervised by Dr Herman Kamper. In this thesis, I investigated the efficacy of a deep neural network for speech search using visual grounding (i.e. no transcriptions). Herman later published a paper, on which I was second author at ICASSP 2019.

I was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. This city will always be my home!

Outside of my academic and professional careers, I am an avid football (or soccer) fan, with a deep affliction with Arsenal.
